\section{Checks}
Each player has a single suit from a standard deck of playing cards which they shuffle and place face down within easy reach. When a player attempts to do something that the
GM deems has a chance of failure, they must make a check by drawing a card from their pile. The card they draw determines whether they succeed or fail, based on the difficulty
level the GM assigns to the action.
